"Irma Vep" is a unique French film that explores the behind-the-scenes world of film production, blending comedy, drama, and a touch of surrealism.

The story follows Cheung's character, an unnamed Hong Kong actress, as she arrives in France to star in the remake of the silent film "Les vampires" (1915). However, her presence causes a chaotic stir, as she clashes with the film's director, played by Jean-Pierre L√©aud, and navigates the petty intrigues and egos that plague the production. Along with the film industry setting, the unique premise of the actress playing herself adds an intriguing layer of complexity to the story. With a runtime of 1 hour and 39 minutes and a cast that also includes Nathalie Richard, "Irma Vep" is a standout in the world of French filmmaking and offers a fresh perspective on the film industry.
