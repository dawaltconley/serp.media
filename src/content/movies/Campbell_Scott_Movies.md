<br>

Cruel and Unusual is a powerful 52-minute documentary that delves into the impact of California's notorious Three Strikes Law on the lives of three unsuspecting individuals. This harsh sentencing law, once the most severe in the United States, resulted in life imprisonment for minor, non-violent offenses such as writing a bad check, shoplifting a VCR, and eating a slice of pizza. The film sheds light on the emotional, social, and financial struggles faced by the protagonists and their families while also exploring the broader implications of such a law on the criminal justice system. With a riveting storyline and a strong IMDb rating of 8.4, Cruel and Unusual serves as a sobering reminder of the potential injustices that can arise from extreme sentencing laws.
