Water (1985) is a thrilling, adventurous dramedy set on a West Indian island nation, where a serene life is disrupted by the arrival of a massive American drilling company. The discovery of a vast natural mineral water source throws the charming British diplomat, played by Michael Caine, into chaos. The movie takes its themes from the cultural clash between the American corporate giants and the local populace. The film's unique mix of adventure, drama, and comedy is elevated by clever references to Mahatma Gandhi and Al Pacino, and a scene during the opening credits that captures the idyllic island setting. Directed by Dick Clement, Water boasts an ensemble cast including Valerie Perrine and Brenda Vaccaro, who engage in humorous interactions in their attempts to navigate the complexities of the situation. Handled by writers Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, and Bill Persky, Water offers a charming balance of light-hearted humor and gripping drama, reflecting the filmmakers' mastery in storytelling.

Water received mixed reviews from critics but was well-received by viewers for its captivating blend of genres. It was released in April 1986 and grossed $1,256,862 worldwide. It's noteworthy for its original take on themes of culture clash and the consequences of unchecked corporate greed.
