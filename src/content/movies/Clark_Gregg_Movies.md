State and Main, a 2000 neo-screwball comedy-drama, invites us into the small New England town of Millbrook as it transforms into the epicenter of a Hollywood movie production. Written and directed by David Mamet, this film serves as a clever commentary on the corruption of our values by the allure of fame and fortune.

The film-within-a-film structure cleverly engages the audience while showcasing intricate character development and plot twists.
