"Idiocracy" is a satirical science-fiction comedy that delves into the realm of political intrigue and bumbling futuristic societies. In a world where the average person resembles Joe Bauers (played by Luke Wilson), a seemingly average American, a top-secret hibernation experiment goes awry. Bauers is forgotten, awakening to a future where he's the most intelligent person due to an environment of relentless stupidity. As a time traveler thrust into a world he doesn't recognize, Joe interacts with its inhabitants, including President Camacho (played by Terry Crews), who embodies the shocking decline in intelligence and morality. This film takes viewers on an outrageously satirical journey, providing sharp commentary on societal regression and the future of humanity. With a running time of just 84 minutes, "Idiocracy" is a high-energy, tongue-in-cheek exploration of our possible future. The film combines absurdity with thought-provoking issues, making it a compelling watch for fans of political comedies and those who appreciate the unique blend of humor and satire found in movies like "Office Space" and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. "
