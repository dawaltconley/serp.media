"Centurion" is a gripping action-drama, helmed by Neil Marshall, and set in Britain in the year 117 AD, a brutal time where Roman soldiers fight for survival against the relentless native tribes. The story unfolds around a small group of Roman soldiers who find themselves trapped behind enemy lines after a devastating guerrilla attack destroys their legion. Left with no other option, they must muster all their courage and combat skills to stay alive, as they are hunted down by the barbarian hunters. The plot thickens as Michael Fassbender ('Inglourious Basterds', 'X-Men: First Class') leads the soldiers in a battle of wits and strength against the relentless Olga Kurylenko ('Quantum of Solace') playing the fierce, high-ranking tracker, Etain. The supporting cast includes Dominic West ('The Wire', 'Tomb Raider') as the fearless Roman centurion, Quintus Dias. This historically-set action film is bolstered by its realistic, blood-soaked battle scenes that reflect the brutalities of the era. The movie's atmospheric settings, combined with its intricate plot, offers the viewers a glimpse into a world of power play and survival. "Centurion" not only entertains with its high-intensity action sequences, but it also tells a story of betrayal, sacrifice, survival, and the fierce power of humanity in its extremity.
