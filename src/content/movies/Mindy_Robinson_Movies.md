In "Bleach" (2022), directed by Michael Edmonds and co-written with Lenka Fucikova, a man is pushed to the brink as he resorts to desperate measures to avoid the vengeful spirits of the girls he killed in a horrific snuff film. With authorities closing in, he must race against time to keep them at bay, all while navigating a web of sinister secrets and the relentless pursuit of justice. Featuring performances by Mindy Robinson, Eric Roberts, and Tara Reid, "Bleach" is a chilling exploration of the darkness that lurks within and the lengths one will go to protect their own.
