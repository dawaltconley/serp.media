40 Years a Prisoner is a thought-provoking documentary that dives deep into the world of police brutality and social injustice. Set in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, this film follows the intense journey of Mike Africa Jr. , a man fighting tooth and nail to exonerate his parents. Both of them were once affiliated with the revolutionary group MOVE, which led to their incarceration.
