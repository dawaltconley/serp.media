" combines the fast-paced action of the crime world with the absurdity of a comedic takeover, all while breaking the fourth wall to keep viewers engaged. The movie, released in 1998, has grossed over $19.9 million worldwide, making it a light-hearted but entertaining addition to the crime genre. For fans of movies like "Hot Shots!
