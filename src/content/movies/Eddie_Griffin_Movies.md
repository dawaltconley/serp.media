Dice Rules is a 1991 cult classic comedy flick that showcases the raw, outrageous, and hilarious stand-up performance of notorious comedian Andrew Dice Clay. The film is a hybrid of stand-up comedy and comedy sketches, recorded at the sold-out Madison Square Gardens, with Dice showcasing his signature misogynistic antics and crude humor. Directed by Jay Dubin and written by Dice Clay himself, the movie is a testament to his unique style, blending vulgar jokes with thought-provoking skits. Dice Rules features appearances by comedians Eddie Griffin and Sylvia Harman, adding to its appeal and star power. The film is an all-out assault on political correctness, earning it a place on the infamous list of "worst movies ever" by Entertainment Weekly. With a runtime of 1 hour and 28 minutes, Dice Rules may not be for the faint of heart or those who prefer their humor more tame. However, for those who enjoy edgy, boundary-pushing comedy, this documentary-style romp offers a unique look at the man and his antics. Despite mixed reviews and a paltry box office gross of $637,327, Dice Rules has become somewhat of a cult classic for fans of its creator. It is worth mentioning that the movie is rated NC-17 and viewer discretion is strongly advised due to its explicit content.
