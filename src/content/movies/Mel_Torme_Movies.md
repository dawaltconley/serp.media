However, it is essential to note that while "Words and Music" provides a glimpse into the duo's life and work, it does so with some artistic liberties. The film does not delve into the complexities of Hart's personal struggles, which may impact the viewer's understanding of the men behind the music. In conclusion, "Words and Music" is a delightful and entertaining musical biography that captures the essence of one of the greatest songwriting partnerships of all times. It is a must-see for fans of Rodgers & Hart and musicals in general, even if it only provides a partially accurate portrayal of the duo's lives.
