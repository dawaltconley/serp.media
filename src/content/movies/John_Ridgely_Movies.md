"They Won't Forget" is a hard-hitting 1937 drama that explores the dangers of political ambition, journalism, and prejudice in small-town America. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy and featuring a star-studded cast including Claude Rains, Gloria Dickson, and Edward Norris, the film exposes the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic communities.
