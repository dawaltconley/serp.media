"Authors Anonymous" is a quirky and humorous 2014 comedy film about a disparate group of unpublished writers who, despite their eccentricities and flaws, form an unexpected bond. When Hannah, an aspiring writer, is welcomed into the fold, nothing prepares them for her sudden rise to fame. As the unconventional group navigates the twists and turns of the publishing world, they must learn to coexist and support each other - or else risk losing more than just their literary aspirations. Starring Kaley Cuoco, Jonathan Banks, and Tricia Helfer, and directed by Ellie Kanner, "Authors Anonymous" explores the trials and tribulations of chasing the American dream through the lens of literary ambition. With a runtime of just over an hour and a half, this delightful film is sure to leave viewers laughing and cheering for the underdogs.
