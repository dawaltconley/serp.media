This time around, the action does not take place in California but in the bustling streets of New York City as a Category 7 hurricane spawns deadly sharknadoes, storm surges, and heavy rain. The story unfolds as Fin and April journey to New York to attend a book signing of Fin's autobiography where he narrates their ordeal from the first sharknado attack. They are, however, caught in yet another sharknado. The only difference this time is the skepticism of the people of New York, who refuse to believe Fin's warning about the impending disaster. With no time to waste, they enlist the help of their ex-girlfriend Skye to save New York from the marauding sharks and their deadly storms. "Sharknado 2: The Second One" continues with all the hilarious action, suspense, and jaw-dropping moments typical of this franchise.
