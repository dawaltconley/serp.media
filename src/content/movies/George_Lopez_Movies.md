"Spare Parts" is an inspiring 2015 drama that chronicles the true story of four high school students from Phoenix, Arizona. Faced with the seemingly insurmountable challenge of creating a competitive robot for a national competition, these Mexican-American youth defy all odds with sheer determination and teamwork. With no prior experience, a meager budget of $800, a thriftiness for salvaging used cars, and a daring dream, they go head to head with the reigning robotics champion, the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The compelling underdog narrative unfolds under the capable guidance of their school counselor, portrayed by George Lopez, and the heartening support of their enthusiastic principal, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. The film, directed by Sean McNamara, artfully weaves themes of resilience, ambition, and camaraderie into a story that transcends its robotics competition premise. It offers an inspiring portrayal of the transformative power of teamwork and determination in the face of adversity. Bolstered by strong performances from the cast, "Spare Parts" is an uplifting and thrilling ride that resonates with audiences worldwide. The movie's unique blend of drama, history, and biography has garnered critical acclaim, earning two wins and two nominations.
