Poms is a heartwarming comedy about a group of spirited retirees in a quaint retirement community who form a cheerleading squad, breaking the norms of age and tradition. The team, led by the charismatic and resilient Diane Keaton, challenges the perceptions of what it means to grow old and prove that age is just a number. As they train together, they find new purpose in life, nurture friendships, and rediscover their inner strength. Directed by Zara Hayes and written by Hayes and Shane Atkinson, Poms stars an impressive ensemble cast, including Jacki Weaver and Celia Weston. With a refreshing take on friendship, comedy, and determination, Poms is a uplifting film that encourages viewers to embrace life's surprises and cherish the bonds of sisterhood.
