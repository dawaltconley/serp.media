<br>

"American Tigers" is an action-packed film set in 1996, where terrorists from around the world have united under a common enemy - their respective governments. When the US army detects this plot, they round up a group of assassins who are scheduled for the firing squad, promising exoneration in exchange for participating in this covert mission. The catch? They must undergo rigorous military training under the demanding style of Sergeant Ransom, master of martial arts. The movie is chock-full of intense action with a focus on both mixed and taekwondo martial arts along with some elements of jujitsu. The key stars include Sam J. Jones, famous for his role as Flash Gordon, the acclaimed actress Cynthia Rothrock who is well-versed in martial arts and Donald Gibb who is known for his roles in movies like Tiger Claws and Tiger Claws III. Directed by David Worth, "American Tigers" is a typical '90s action flick, with familiar faces and thrilling fight scenes, a perfect blend of violence, martial arts, and military precision. The film has all the right elements to keep die-hard action fans hooked to their screens. However, the IMDb rating of 4.3 with just over 168 votes suggests it might not have attained widespread success. "American Tigers" bears a striking resemblance to several other action films from the '90s with a few similarities such as "Lady Dragon, " "Deep Cover, " "Rage and Honor, " and more, suggesting it follows a predictable action-movie plot but still manages to offer a thrilling experience for those who love martial arts-driven action movies.
