"The Making of '. . and God Spoke'" is a hilarious and satirical look into the behind-the-scenes chaos of producing a high-profile Bible film. This 1993 American comedy, helmed by director Arthur Borman, will have you in stitches as everything that could go wrong on set does, making for a witty and engaging viewing experience. With a strong ensemble featuring Michael Riley, Stephen Rappaport, and Tamara Mello, the film explores the absurdities and mishaps that plague the production of this epic film about faith and divine intervention. Expect all the typical big-budget movie pitfalls, along with clever references to the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ. Even more impressive is the mastery of deadpan humor, delivered through a spoof narrative that pokes tongue-in-cheek fun at the glitches, bloopers, and downright silliness that unfolds in front of the lens. "The Making of '. . and God Spoke'" offers a refreshing take on the comedy genre that will have you both entertained and amused. Despite its runtime of just 82 minutes, it packs an impressive comedic punch with its brilliant blend of satire, witty banter, and slapstick humor. So, if you're in the mood for some light-hearted fun, look no further than "The Making of '. . and God Spoke'". This cult classic doesn't take itself too seriously, resulting in a film that is not only immensely enjoyable but also cleverly subversive, leaving viewers with a hearty dose of laughs and a whole lot of fun. Remember, this is not the story of the Bible, but instead a mockery of the follies that occur when attempting to bring divine tales to life on camera. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the mayhem in this comedic tribute to the unpredictable nature of filmmaking.
