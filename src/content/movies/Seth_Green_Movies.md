<br>

"Sex Drive, " directed by Sean Anders, is a raucous comedy-romance that follows a high school senior named Ian played by Josh Zuckerman. Emboldened by his discovery of the mysterious online babe, Erika played by Amanda Crew, Ian sets out to drive across the country with his two best friends, Saul (Clark Duke) and Lance (Nathan Stevens). Their wild and reckless journey takes them through a series of outrageous encounters and misadventures involving anal sex, female nudity, and all sorts of scandalous fun. "Sex Drive" is an uproarious take on the road trip genre that mixes a bit of romance with copious amounts of crude humor. The film also touches on the importance of friendship and coming of age as the trio discovers what it really means to be true to oneself. With a run time of 109 minutes, the movie takes a lively approach to the typical "coming of age" plot. Fans of similar road trip comedies like "Road Trip" or "She's Out of My League" will appreciate "Sex Drive's" offbeat blend of sexual humor and youthful indiscretion. Overall, this 2008 film offers a brash and bold look at teenage life from the creators of Summit Entertainment, Alloy Entertainment and Goldcrest Pictures. So, buckle up and prepare yourself for a wild ride that's as much about the journey as it is about the destination.
