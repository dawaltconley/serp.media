"Lakeview Terrace" (2008), a taut thriller, takes us to a suburban neighborhood where a seemingly friendly interracial couple, Chris and Lisa, move next to the house of Abel Turner, a troubled and unapologetically racist L. A. P. D. officer. The young couple's dream home quickly turns into a nightmare as Turner launches a campaign to force them out. What started as unsettling pranks escalates into a series of alarming encounters, revealing a twisted and dangerous man driven by hate and double standards. Directed by Neil LaBute and featuring Samuel L. Jackson as the terrifyingly menacing cop, "Lakeview Terrace" is a gripping tale of suburban tension, inter-personal conflicts, and the darker side of human nature.
