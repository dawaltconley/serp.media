<br>

Inkubus is a chilling supernatural horror movie that transports you to a soon to be demolished police station for an unforgettable night of terror. With a runtime of just 1 hour and 20 minutes, the film delves into the mysterious and gruesome world of its main antagonist, Inkubus, a seemingly inexhaustible serial killer with a thirst for blood. As the story unfolds, a skeleton crew is left to work the final shift at the deserted station under the watchful eye of the demon. The night takes a grisly turn as Inkubus nonchalantly struts into the station, holding the severed head of a murdered girl. The demon takes delight in revealing his litany of crimes before engaging in a chilling game of cat and mouse with the crew. Inkubus features a star-studded cast, including horror legend Robert Englund and William Forsythe, as well as pop icon Joey Fatone. Directed by Glenn Ciano and written by Ciano and Carl V. Dupr√©, the movie offers a thrilling blend of horror and suspense. With a disappointing IMDb rating of 3.8, Inkubus is not a universally acclaimed film, but for fans of supernatural horror, it is definitely worth a watch. If you're a fan of movies like Nightworld: Door of Hell or The Funhouse Massacre, Inkubus should be on your radar. However, be warned, this film may not be suitable for all audiences due to its graphic content and rating of R.
