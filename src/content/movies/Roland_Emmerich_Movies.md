"Das Shakespeare R√§tsel" delves deep into the enigma surrounding the authorship of William Shakespeare's renowned works. This 43-minute documentary, set to be released in 2011, challenges the conventional belief that Shakespeare, the world's most famous author, is indeed the true writer behind his own literary fame. The film highlights the striking fact that despite having no university degree, no significant connections in the literary field, and seemingly no literary belongings, Shakespeare's works somehow managed to become globally recognized, a feat often described as his 'surprising success'. But beyond speculation, the film is a well-researched exploration into the potentiality of alternative authorships. With contributions from notable stars such as Bastian Conrad, Roland Emmerich, and Gert Heidenreich, the movie offers a gripping depiction of the age-old mystery behind the Bard of Avon's literary prowess.
