"Agent 38-24-36, " a 1964 French comedy directed by √âdouard Molinaro, follows the misadventures of a hapless, easily confused Russian spy. Despite a mission to steal some forged orders, the agent's ineptness makes the task almost impossible ‚Äì he is even more gullible than your run-of-the-mill CIA recruit. Things go downhill when his girlfriend, a femme in legwear, tries to assist him ‚Äì only to learn that he's as dense as a sack of cement. The movie is a tongue-in-cheek poke at spy movies, complete with plot twists, gags that had viewers laughing in the 1960s, and an air of absurdity that's hard to resist. Brigitte Bardot plays the role of the love interest, an attempt to make this spy's life a tad more tolerable; Anthony Perkins joins as a crucial supporting cast member. This comedy was produced by Flora Film and Les Productions Belles Rives and could possibly be enjoyed by fans of films like 'Moulin Rouge, ' 'Two Weeks in September, ' 'The Trial, ' 'Love on a Pillow, ' 'Les femmes, ' 'The Female, ' 'Her Bridal Night, ' 'Please, Not Now! , ' 'The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot, ' 'Come Dance with Me! , ' 'Viva Maria! , ' and 'La Parisienne. ' 

However, its IMDB rating of 5.5 indicates it might not be universally loved, so viewers should approach with caution. It stars Brigitte Bardot, Anthony Perkins, and Gr√©goire Aslan.
