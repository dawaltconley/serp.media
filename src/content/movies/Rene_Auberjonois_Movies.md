"Kingdom of David: The Saga of the Israelites" is a compelling documentary that delves into the rich history of the Israelites in the 6th century B. C. The film explores the tumultuous times of the northern tribes of Israelites who were taken into exile and vanished forever. This is juxtaposed with the southern tribes of the Israelites, who were led to exile in Babylon in 586 B. C. Yet, despite the seemingly imminent disappearance of the Judean people, they fought back through the power of literature, writing a book that would later become the Old Testament, drawing from the stories of their ancestors. This powerful narrative is recounted through the lens of history, using reenactments that bring the world of the Israelites to life. Directed by Carl Byker and Mitch Wilson, the documentary is written by Carl Byker, Isaac Mizrahi, and David Mrazek. With a runtime of 3 hours and 40 minutes, it's a thorough exploration of a pivotal period in world history. Starring F. Murray Abraham, Rene Auberjonois, and Jake Borowski, among others, this film promises a captivating journey back in time.
