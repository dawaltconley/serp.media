"Pretty Baby" is a powerful drama set in 1917 New Orleans, where the main character is a preteen girl who is forced into a life of prostitution. This film, from its inception to its release in 1978, has been surrounded by controversy due to its explicit portrayal of child prostitution and underage sex. Directed by Louis Malle and co-written by Polly Platt, "Pretty Baby" starred a then-15-year-old Brooke Shields, who won numerous awards, including a Golden Globe, for her intense portrayal of the tragic character. The film garnered six Academy Award nominations and a win for Best Music, Song, for "Pretty Baby". Despite the controversy surrounding its themes and explicit content, "Pretty Baby" remains an important piece of both cinematic and social history. The film served as a stark exposure to the harsh realities and exploitative nature of child labour in its various forms, shining a light on the societal and familial issues that contributed to this tragic scenario. "Pretty Baby" was not just a film but a daring exploration of the stark reality of a world few dared to visualize. As Brooke Shields‚Äô character navigates her way through the gritty underbelly of New Orleans, the audience is given a window into the dark heart of a society that was all too willing to turn a blind eye. The film is rated R due to its graphic depiction of child prostitution, underage sex scenes and nudity, but its unflinching portrayal serves as a stark warning and plea for change. It remains a powerful and challenging piece of cinematic art, proving that sometimes, the truth does hurt.
