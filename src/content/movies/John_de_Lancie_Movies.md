Zombie Hamlet is a unique comedy film that sees a passionate filmmaker's ambitious plan to re-envision Hamlet taking place during the American Civil War, only to encounter unexpected changes.

The characters face numerous challenges, from explosions to plantation-based shoots, as they battle to bring their vision to life. Travis Wester, John Amos, and A. J. Buckley headline the star-studded cast, adding a layer of depth and talent to this comical production. Directed by John Murlowski and written by John McKinney, the film is a testament to the creative spirit that can transform even the darkest of works into unexpected comedies. Despite a modest IMDb rating of 4.6, Zombie Hamlet offers viewers a wild, entertaining ride through the world of low-budget zombie comedies. With a box office gross yet to be determined, this film will undoubtedly leave audiences questioning what could have been, while embracing the unexpected joys of a budget-driven production.
