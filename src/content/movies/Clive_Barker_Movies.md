In the gripping 2021 sequel, Candyman, the chilling urban legend returns to its haunting origins in a now-gentrified Chicago neighborhood. A fresh set of characters, all African American, become entangled in the macabre world of the Candyman, a hook-handed slasher killer based on an urban legend involving a bee sting. Director Nia DaCosta and writers Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld, and DaCosta masterfully weave together the terrifying tale of how the past refuses to stay buried. With a stellar cast, including Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Candyman is a thrilling horror-thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
