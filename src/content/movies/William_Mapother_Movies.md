In the wild west year of 1908, CHIEF (Mario Van Peebles) is ready to reclaim stolen reparations gold hidden deep in the heart of Montana. With a dark past and years spent in hiding, he's not letting anyone get in the way of his destiny. But hot on his heels is a dogged adversary named ANGEL (William Mapother), who has one thing on his mind: gold, and won't stop until he gets his hands on it.
