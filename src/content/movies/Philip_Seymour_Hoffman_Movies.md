State and Main, a 2000 neo-screwball comedy-drama, invites us into the small New England town of Millbrook as it transforms into the epicenter of a Hollywood movie production. Written and directed by David Mamet, this film serves as a clever commentary on the corruption of our values by the allure of fame and fortune. The residents, led by the charming, yet desperate, Mayor Richards (William H. Macy), are more than eager to give up their principles in exchange for a taste of the glitz and glamour. The movie crew, led by uptight director Wilson Jerome (Philip Seymour Hoffman), inadvertently wreaks havoc on the town's moral fabric as they pursue their ambitions. The film-within-a-film structure cleverly engages the audience while showcasing intricate character development and plot twists. State and Main is filled with witty, satirical humor, and heartfelt drama, offering a truly unique cinematic experience. The ensemble cast, comprising some of the biggest names in Hollywood and independent cinema, breathes life into the intricate narrative, further solidifying State and Main's status as an underappreciated gem. With 22,032 IMDb votes and a solid box office success of $6,944,471, State and Main is a must-watch for fans of comedy, drama, and political commentary.
