In the small, seemingly peaceful rural community of Lucky Hollow, a dark, sinister secret is resurrected as the enigmatic killer scarecrow prepares to terrorize the town once again. When Chris Rhymer and her young son Jeremy arrive, they unwittingly disturb the unsettling past that tormented the forgotten corners of this forgotten place. They soon find themselves in the clutches of a supernatural serial killer whose elusive presence casts a malevolent shadow over the community and transforms the familiar into the fearsome.
