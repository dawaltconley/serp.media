"Windrunner" is a heartwarming family fantasy film, released in 1994. The story revolves around a young man named Windrunner, who moves with his mother to a town in the U. S. Southwest, where his father is serving time in a penitentiary. Unsurprisingly, the new town is filled with discrimination against him due to his father's criminal past. However, Windrunner finds solace in a unique and unlikely source: the ghost of Jim Thorpe, a Native American folk hero. Jim Thorpe not only guides Windrunner, but also teaches him valuable life lessons about perseverance and self-belief. The film offers a reference to William Shakespeare's famous line, "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players, " as Windrunner realizes that he is not just a victim of circumstance, but a character in a broader play. "Windrunner" is not just an exciting story about a young man's journey towards acceptance and understanding; it's also a subtle commentary on the complexities of life in a small town and the societal stigma that often accompanies criminality. Directed by William Clark and William Tannen, and written by Mitch Davis, the film's star-studded cast includes Jason Wiles, Russell Means, and Margot Kidder.
