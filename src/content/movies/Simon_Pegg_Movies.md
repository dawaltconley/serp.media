"Hot Fuzz: Hot Funk - The TV Version" is a humorous four-minute long extra featuring the renowned British film "Hot Fuzz".

This transformation showcases not only their acting capabilities but also a rare, playful side of them, known only to the film's dedicated fanbase. For those who've watched "Hot Fuzz, " the silliness of replacing swearing with "funk" is an intriguing inside joke. For the uninitiated, it's a delightful peek into the TV adaptation's quirky humor.
