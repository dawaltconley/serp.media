"Official Selection" is a witty and satirical short comedy film released in 2008, running for a mere 10 minutes. With a runtime that barely scratches the surface, this film packs a punch and leaves viewers in stitches. Directed by Brian Crano and written by the same genius, this movie features a trio of young, talented actors, Rebecca Hall, Stephen Campbell Moore, and Freddie Stevenson. The movie has a unique plot that seems to take a playful, almost cheeky jab at Jesus Christ, and with the tagline being non-existent, it leaves the audience intrigued without spoiling any surprises. The film is categorized under the genres of short and comedy, indicating a light-hearted, humorous take on a serious subject. Although "Official Selection" did not win any major awards, it certainly made a statement with its limited runtime. The movie's IMDb rating is surprisingly low at 5.1, but the 74.0 votes suggest that it might not be as universally disliked as the rating suggests. The production budget was a modest $10,000, and despite not being a blockbuster, it successfully took on the big screen. If you're looking for a quick, hilarious break from your routine, consider watching "Official Selection". It's a fun, satirical comedy that blends humor and depth in a short but memorable time.
