Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a thrilling, action-packed addition to the Marvel Comics Universe. The sequel to the 2018 film, "Venom, " picks up where we left off with the reluctant anti-hero, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). Eddie is back in the driver's seat as Venom, seeking to make amends for his past. His new target? Serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who has been waiting in death row for his chance at revenge. With Cletus becoming the host for the symbiote Carnage, chaos erupts as he escapes from prison. Directed by Andy Serkis and written by Kelly Marcel and Tom Hardy, Venom: Let There Be Carnage promises to deliver an adrenaline-fueled, edge-of-your-seat experience for viewers.
