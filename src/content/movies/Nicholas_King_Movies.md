"Extreme Prejudice" is an intense 1987 action crime drama that centers around the unlikely adversaries of childhood friends: a Texas Ranger, portrayed by Nick Nolte, and a ruthless narcotics kingpin. Set against the backdrop of a gritty, noir Western landscape, the film explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and their consequences when they clash with duty and justice. Among the talented ensemble cast is the late Powers Boothe as the ominous kingpin, and Michael Ironside bringing an unpredictable layer to the character of a mercenary. Directed by Walter Hill with a screenplay featuring the works of John Milius, Fred Rexer, and Deric Washburn, viewers are offered a gripping exploration of the complexities of human relationships and the devastating fallout of taking sides in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. With a runtime of 1 hour and 45 minutes and an IMDb rating of 6.6, "Extreme Prejudice" leaves audiences on the edge of their seats, grappling with questions of morality and the cost of revenge. The movie delivers thrilling action, memorable dialogues, and compelling performances. If you're a fan of films with morally ambiguous characters, suspenseful plot twists, and a hint of '80s nostalgia, "Extreme Prejudice" could be the perfect choice for you. Notably, while the movie leans into a few scenes of mature content, it doesn't necessarily warrant the R content rating. However, if you're looking for a film that explores some mature themes, be warned that "Extreme Prejudice" delves into moments of violence, drug use, and mature language. Join Nolte's Ranger, Boothe's enigmatic kingpin, and Ironside's mercenary in a high-octane journey filled with suspense, action, and a hefty dose of moral complexity. With "Extreme Prejudice", every scene counts, and every decision has consequences.
