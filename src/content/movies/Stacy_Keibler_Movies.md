His uncensored art catches the attention of the art world, dragging him into the glitzy, pretentious world of New York City. However, stepping into the glittering spotlight isn't all it seems. As Pecker's fame and notoriety grow, so does conflict with his roots and the people he loves. This film pokes fun at the artistic establishment and the hypocrisy it hides. "Pecker" stars a young Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. The film was nominated for an award and won two others, adding to its cult-status appeal. Despite its edgy themes, the film is both entertaining and thought-provoking, making it a must-watch for fans of dark comedies.
