Hughley, and Paul Rodriguez, this film follows a retired sports star down on his luck. His get-rich plan? Start a volleyball team, but with a twist: the players are all strippers. With themes from the worlds of comedy and sport, "Cloud 9" delves into the unpredictable adventures of this motley crew of athletes. Balancing the outrageous premise with genuinely comedic moments, the film is a lighthearted exploration of teamwork. Expect nudity and adult content, as stripping takes center stage as a central element of the narrative.
