As the characters grapple with the challenges of bringing Sterne's narrative to life, the film weaves a satirical commentary on the creative process and the realities of behind-the-scenes life. With a runtime of 1 hour and 34 minutes, Tristram Shandy has won 2 BAFTA Awards and received 14 nominations.
