In the midst of this dangerous world, he meets Letty Lane, a wild debutante whose boyfriend Steve Lawrence is a mob mouthpiece. Letty's kinder, more refined sister, Susan, adds another layer of complexity to Jim's life. As he navigates among these perilous situations, he finds a way to use his experiences and skills to confront the gangsters directly.
