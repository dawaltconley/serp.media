"Bloom: A New Reverence for Water" is a profoundly informative 28-minute documentary that arose in 2012 as a compelling response to the growing concern about the consequences of urbanization on our natural water cycles. As we continue to expand our cities, towns, and roads, we're witnessing a significant increase in impervious surfaces, which are causing more stormwater run-off and less capacity for natural absorption and cleansing of our water. With climate change expected to exacerbate intense and frequent storms in the coming years, it's crucial that we rethink our approach to urban design to prevent flood damage and pollution. Directed by Victor A. Guadagno and highlighted by the insight of stars like Chris Cooper, "Bloom: A New Reverence for Water" provides a much-needed look at how we can respect and protect our sources of water. By exploring how cities like Santa Monica, California, have transformed their landscapes into sustainable green infrastructures, the film teaches valuable lessons on how we can coexist harmoniously with nature and ensure the health of our ecosystems. Despite its short runtime, "Bloom: A New Reverence for Water" is a transformative experience that delivers critical information about sustainable urban development and a newfound reverence for water. This documentary is a must-watch for anyone interested in preserving the quality and quantity of our water resources and understanding the role urban landscapes play in safeguarding our environment.
