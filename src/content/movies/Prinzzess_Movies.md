"Diana: Her True Story", a 1993 biographical drama, offers an intimate portrayal of Princess Diana, the Princess of Wales who is renowned for her warmth and charm as much as the difficulties in her marriage to Prince Charles. Filmed at a time when the couple's turbulent relationship was already public knowledge, before their much-publicized divorce and her untimely demise, the movie unravels the intricacies of their private lives. Directed by Kevin Connor and scripts penned by Andrew Morton and Stephen Zito, this 3-hour narrative stars Serena Scott Thomas as Princess Diana and David Threlfall as Prince Charles. They are joined by Elizabeth Garvie, further enhancing the movie's authenticity. Despite its IMDb rating of 4.7 based on 228 votes, "Diana: Her True Story" is noteworthy for its candid depiction of the British royal family, particularly Princess Diana and Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles. The movie is produced by Martin Poll Productions and filmed in the United Kingdom, lending the story its local charm. This film is for those who are fans of the British royal family and want to delve into the lesser known facets of their lives, especially the Princess of Wales. While the movie can be perceived as a rather heavy watch with a runtime of 3 hours and 1 minute, it's undeniably an opportunity to witness a unique and unapologetic perspective of Princess Diana. The movie is not short of similar films to choose from, but "Diana: Her True Story" distinctly stands out, promising a stirring and emotive narrative around the Princess of Wales.
