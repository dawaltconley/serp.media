"Dog Eat Dog" unwraps the gripping tale of a group of ex-cons on an audacious mission. Set to the backdrop of Cleveland's mafia battleground, a local Mafioso enlists them to kidnap a rival mobster's infant. As the narrative unfolds across a haze of action, crime, and thrills, the line between friendship and loyalty is blurred to a degree where trust becomes hard to find. This suspenseful film, featuring captivating performances by Nicolas Cage, Willem Dafoe, and Christopher Matthew Cook, delves deep into the gritty dark side of the criminal underworld. With a runtime of an intense 93 minutes, the film is expertly crafted by director Paul Schrader, penned by Edward Bunker and Matthew Wilder, and produced by ADME Studios, Blue Budgie Films Limited, and Dark Mark Productions. The movie made its debut on the 11th of November, 2016 and is spoken in English. Despite not having a specific content rating, it has delivered on its promise of a compelling action-crime thriller, garnering 4.8 on IMDb from nearly 10,000 ratings, although it had a box office of only $184,404. 

"Dog Eat Dog" shares similarities with other suspenseful thrillers like "Dark" and "Dying of the Light", making it a riveting watch for fans of this genre. If intrigue and tension are what keep you on the edge of your seat, "Dog Eat Dog" should definitely be on your must-watch list. But remember, this edge-of-your-seat film may not be for everyone as it explores themes of crime, violence, and morally questionable actions. It's also worth bearing in mind that like many suspense thrillers, the narrative may contain instances of child murderer, strip club, gun held to head, hand job, and baby, making it unsuitable for sensitive viewers. However, if suspense and high-stakes criminal underworld intrigue is your thing, give "Dog Eat Dog" a watch. You won't be disappointed.
