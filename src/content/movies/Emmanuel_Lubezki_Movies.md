Roma, directed by the talented Alfonso Cuar√≥n, offers a profound exploration of class differences and the lives of ordinary people in Mexico City during the early 1970s. The story is narrated from the perspective of a middle-class family's maid, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), as we delve into the intricacies of her relationship with her employers and the challenges she faces.
