Music" (2021) is a powerful and inspiring drama-musical directed by Sia, starring Kate Hudson as Zu, a newly sober woman who takes on the responsibility of being the sole guardian of her half-sister Music (Maddie Ziegler), who is on the autism spectrum. As the two form an unbreakable bond and journey through life's challenges, the film delves into Sia's beloved themes of self-discovery and family creation. The heartwarming story also explores the importance of understanding and providing love to those with non-verbal communication, adding a unique perspective to the narrative.
