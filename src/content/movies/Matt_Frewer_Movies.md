<br>

"Weirdsville" is a black comedy that tells the tale of two lazy, good-for-nothing guys who unwittingly get caught up in a whirlwind of dark crimes. In a desperate attempt to rid themselves of the dead body of a dead girlfriend, they decide to dispose of it in the most ill-chosen location possible - the basement of a drive-in movie theater, which happens to be the chosen spot for a satanic cult to carry out their gruesome rituals. As if that wasn't enough, their plight only worsens as they end up being enlisted as members of the satanic cult. They're faced with an impossible decision - either succumb to the dark powers they're drawn into, or risk their lives fighting against the sinister forces that threaten to consume their world. Throughout the film, which is set against the backdrop of an unremarkable, suburban town, the two hapless protagonists stumble through a series of surreal, hilarious, and sometimes terrifying scenarios that test their mettle and challenge everything they thought they knew about their lives. With a satanic cult, a dead body, and an unassuming drive-in movie theater, "Weirdsville" takes viewers on a rollicking, offbeat journey filled with unexpected twists and turns. Directed by Allan Moyle (known for his work on "Rock n Roll High School" and "Roadhouse") and written by Willem Wennekers, Sarah Dodd, and Bob Conte, this film proves that some of the most interesting stories lie in the most unexpected places. Starring Scott Speedman ("Felicity", "Underworld"), Wes Bentley ("American Beauty", "The Hunger Games"), and Taryn Manning ("Hustle & Flow", "Orange Is the New Black"), "Weirdsville" offers a unique blend of comedy, crime, and drama that pushes the boundaries of what viewers might expect from a standard film.
