A Fool and His Money, formerly known as Religion, Inc. , is a 1989 film that brings humor and drama to the concept of starting a religion. Ex-adman Morris Codman receives an unexpected message from God, instructing him to start his own business venture. Codman interprets this as a divine plan to launch his own religion, founded on the principles of selfishness. Starring Jonathan Penner, Gerald Orange, and Sandra Bullock, the film features a colorful cast of characters who become involved in Codman's growing religious organization. With elements of comedy and drama, A Fool and His Money navigates the complexities of faith, business, and self-interest. Directed by Daniel Adams and written by Daniel Adams and Michael Mailer, this thought-provoking film explores the relationship between religion and capitalism, challenging traditional beliefs and expectations. Despite its modest $6 million budget and a disappointing IMDb rating of 3.6, A Fool and His Money remains a unique and engaging cinematic experience. Not to be confused with similar movies such as Who Shot Pat? , Love Potion No. 9, or Working Girl, A Fool and His Money offers a fresh and intriguing perspective on the intersection of religion and business.
