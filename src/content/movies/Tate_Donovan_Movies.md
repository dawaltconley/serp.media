"Rising Son" is a heartfelt drama from the year 1990 that chronicles the struggles of a father and son grappling with the harsh realities of modern life. Starring the brilliant Brian Dennehy, the film follows an experienced factory foreman who, after being laid off due to a takeover, spirals into despair.

As the two confront their new situations, emotions run high, and their relationship is pushed to its limits. The tension escalates when an ambitious young man takes a position at the foreman's former employer. This new addition to the factory casts an ominous shadow over the lives of our protagonists. Directed by John David Coles and written by Bill Phillips, Rafael Yglesias, and Lewis Cole, "Rising Son" is an evocative exploration of the changing dynamics of family life and the challenges faced by workers adapting to the industrial landscape.
