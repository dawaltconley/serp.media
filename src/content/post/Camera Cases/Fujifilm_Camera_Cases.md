I recently purchased the MegaGear Ever Ready Leather Camera Case and Strap for my Fujifilm X-T10 and 18-55mm lens, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. The dark brown leather case gives my camera a sophisticated touch while providing ample protection against scratches, dust, and other damage. 

The design of this case is not only visually appealing but also incredibly functional. The bottom half can be used independently as a half case, and it attaches easily to the built-in tripod mounting screw. This means I can use my camera with the case on even when it's mounted on a tripod. 

One of my favorite features of this case is the access to the battery compartment. The top part of the case has an opening, allowing me to change the battery without having to remove the entire case. 

However, there are a few minor issues with the design. The vertical portion of the back could be slightly taller for a better fit, and the placement of the snaps could be adjusted to accommodate various tripods. Nonetheless, these are small inconveniences compared to the overall benefits of this case. 

In conclusion, the MegaGear Ever Ready Leather Camera Case and Strap is a great addition for anyone looking to protect their Fujifilm X-T10 or X-T20 camera and lens while adding a touch of elegance.
