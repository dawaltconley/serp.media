I recently purchased the Tonyliaijiantao Camera Case, and I absolutely adore it! This little gadget is perfect for protecting my Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 Instant Camera. 

The first thing that caught my eye was its adorable design. The case comes in various cute patterns that give it a playful touch. It's not only visually appealing but also made of high-quality, semi-waterproof PVC leather, ensuring durability. 

Another feature I appreciated was its professional protective interior. The new hard plastic provides excellent protection against bumps and falls, keeping my camera safe and sound. The dimensions (5.12" x 2.05" x 5.51") are just right for my camera, excluding lens components. 

One of my favorite parts about this product is the ease of use. The magnetic buttons and adjustable shoulder strap make it incredibly convenient to use without having to remove the case every time. The attached pocket is perfect for storing photos or other accessories. 

The only downside I noticed was that the lens component needs to be detached from the camera when closing the case. However, this wasn't a deal-breaker for me as the level of protection and convenience it offers are worth it. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Tonyliaijiantao Camera Case for anyone looking to protect their Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 Instant Camera while adding a touch of personality!
