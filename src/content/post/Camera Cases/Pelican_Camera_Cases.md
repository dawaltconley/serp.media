I recently purchased the Pelican 1120 Case with Foam to protect my camera gear while I'm on the go. This case has truly exceeded my expectations in terms of durability, design, and overall functionality. 

One of the standout features of this case is its sturdiness. It's made with high-quality copolymer polypropylene, which means it's not only strong but also lightweight. Additionally, it has an open-cell core and solid-wall construction, making it resistant to water, crush, and dust. I've used it in various outdoor activities, including camping and hiking, and it's kept my camera safe and dry in all conditions. 

Another highlight is the automatic pressure equalization valve that balances interior pressure and keeps water out. It's a small feature but makes a big difference when protecting sensitive equipment. Additionally, the customizable Pick n Pluck foam interior allows me to create a tailored fit for my camera and lens, ensuring everything stays secure. 

However, there are some cons to consider. It's heavier than other cases on the market, which can be a bit cumbersome when traveling long distances. If you're looking for a lightweight option, this might not be the best choice.
