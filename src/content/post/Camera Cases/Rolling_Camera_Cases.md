I recently got my hands on the Slinger Bigbag Simple 15 DSLR Roller Bag, and I must say, this camera bag has been life-changing for me! As a budding photographer, I was always frustrated with having my camera gear scattered in different bags. This little wonder has been instrumental in helping me keep all my stuff organized and in one place.

There's a dedicated spot for everything, even for your tripod or monopod and a full-sized 15-inch laptop! 

One of the unique features of this bag is the interior dividers. They not only help me compartmentalize my stuff, but they also provide a level of maximum protection for my delicate gear. The padded sleeves for the laptop and accessories are a big plus, giving me peace of mind when I'm on the move. 

Despite its capacity, the bag is surprisingly lightweight and easy to carry around. The padded handles on top and side make it comfortable to hold, while the covered zipper closures with inter-loop locks ensure my stuff stays secure. The built-in tripod securing loop bands are a godsend, keeping my tripod steady and within easy reach. 

Another thing that won me over is the exterior. The weatherproof design, aided by a rain slicker shield, ensures my gear stays dry even in the harshest conditions. The document, manual, and personal item spaces are perfect for storing essentials like IDs and insurance papers. Plus, the instant access memory card pockets make it easy to grab my memory cards on the go. 

The shock-absorbing polyurethane wheels are another highlight. They roll smoothly and quietly, thanks to their high-quality bearings. The quickdraw retractable extension handle makes it easy to maneuver, even in crowded spaces. The fact that it can be transformed into standard luggage for non-photo voyages is just the icing on the cake! 

Oh, and I can't forget the external pouches. They're perfect for carrying travel documents, filters, cables, releases, batteries, and cleaning essentials. They make it easy to keep everything organized and easily accessible, which is a huge win in my book.

## Buyer's Guide

Rolling camera cases are essential tools for photographers and videographers, designed to protect and transport their valuable cameras, lenses, and accessories safely and efficiently. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss important features, considerations, and general advice for rolling camera cases to help you make an informed decision when purchasing one. 


### Size and Capacity


Consider the size and capacity of the rolling camera case based on the amount and type of photography equipment you own. A well-organized case allows you to quickly access your gear and prevents damage during transport. Make sure the case has adjustable or removable dividers to customize its interior to fit your specific needs. In addition, ensure that the total weight of the case and its contents does not exceed the manufacturer's weight capacity to avoid strain on the case's wheels and handle. 


### Durability and Material

Rolling camera cases are subject to continuous wear and tear, so durability and material quality are essential factors to consider. Look for cases made of lightweight yet sturdy materials like polycarbonate, TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethane), or aluminum, which provide excellent protection against impacts and the elements. Durable zippers, handles, and wheel systems are also crucial to ensure a reliable and long-lasting case. 


### Wheel System and Maneuverability

The wheel system and maneuverability of the rolling camera case play a significant role in its usability. Choose cases with rugged, all-terrain wheels that can withstand different surfaces without compromising their performance. Telescopic handles should offer comfortable grips and be adjustable in height for customized control. Ball-bearing wheels are a bonus, as they provide smoother and quieter movement, reducing strain on your arms and reducing the risk of equipment damage during transport. 



### TSA-Approved Lock

For added security, opt for rolling camera cases with TSA-approved combination locks. This enables airport security personnel to inspect your camera case without damaging the lock or the contents inside. These locks also provide protection against theft and unauthorized access to your valuable photography equipment. 


### Weather Resistance and Waterproofing

Ensure that the rolling camera case offers adequate protection against weather elements and moisture. A case with a weather-resistant outer shell, sealed zippers, and a rain cover will help keep your camera gear safe and dry during outdoor shoots, air travel, or inclement weather conditions. 


### Warranty and Customer Support


Finally, before purchasing a rolling camera case, check the manufacturer's warranty and customer support options. A comprehensive warranty can provide peace of mind by covering defects or damage due to normal wear and tear. Additionally, prompt and helpful customer support can be invaluable when addressing any issues or concerns related to your rolling camera case. 

By considering these essential features and advice, you can make a well-informed decision when selecting the perfect rolling camera case to protect and transport your precious photography gear. 


## FAQ


### What features should I look for in a rolling camera case?

When choosing a rolling camera case, consider factors such as the number of compartments, their size, and materials. Durability, ease of use, and compatibility with your camera equipment are also important to ensure your gear is protected and well-organized while you're on the move. 



### How do I know if a rolling camera case is the right size for my equipment?

Before purchasing a rolling camera case, measure the dimensions of your camera, lenses, and other equipment. Compare these measurements to the case's internal dimensions, ensuring there is enough room for all your gear while maintaining proper organization and protection. 


### What is the difference between hard-shell and soft-shell rolling camera cases?

Hard-shell cases offer increased protection for your camera equipment due to their rigid materials and construction. However, they may be heavier and more expensive than soft-shell cases. Soft-shell cases, while less protective, are often lighter and more affordable. Choose the option that best suits your needs and budget. 


### How do I clean and maintain my rolling camera case?


Regularly inspect the case and its components for signs of wear and tear. Clean the exterior with a damp, non-abrasive cloth, and dry it thoroughly before storing. Tighten any loose screws, and replace worn or damaged parts as needed. Proper maintenance can extend the life of your rolling camera case and keep your gear secure. 


### How can I secure my camera equipment inside the rolling case?

Many rolling camera cases come with adjustable or customizable dividers, allowing you to separate and secure your equipment. Make sure all compartments are properly lined with dividers, and ensure lenses, bodies, and other items are snugly fitting within their designated areas to minimize movement while in transit. 


### Which type of wheels is best for a rolling camera case?

Rolling camera cases often come with either inline skate wheels or spinner wheels. Inline skate wheels provide a smoother roll on relatively even surfaces, such as airport floors. Spinner wheels offer better maneuverability, allowing you to effortlessly navigate through crowded spaces or tight corners. 


### What is the typical weight capacity for a rolling camera case?

The weight capacity of a rolling camera case can vary significantly depending on the materials and construction. Some can support loads up to 50 pounds or more, while others may have lower weight capacities. Always check the manufacturer's specifications and consider your equipment's combined weight when choosing a case. 


### How do I safely store my rolling camera case when not in use?

To prolong the life of your rolling camera case, store it in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight. Avoid stacking heavy items on top of the case, as this can cause damage to the exterior and compromise the case's structural integrity over time.
