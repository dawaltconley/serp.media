<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=neewer-portable-3-sections-stretchable-handheld-microphone-boom-pole-with-standard-5-8-inch-27-threa-1"><img alt="neewer-portable-3-sections-stretchable-handheld-microphone-boom-pole-with-standard-5-8-inch-27-threa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/neewer-portable-3-sections-stretchable-handheld-microphone-boom-pole-with-standard-5-8-inch-27-threa-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Complete Boom Microphone Set](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=complete-boom-microphone-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=samson-mk5-boom-microphone-kit-1"><img alt="samson-mk5-boom-microphone-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/samson-mk5-boom-microphone-kit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a voiceover artist, I have always craved for some professional touch to my recordings. The Samson - MK5 (Boom Microphone Kit) has been a game-changer for me, perfectly combining portability with durability. When I first received this kit, it felt like I was opening a treasure chest. The heavy-duty boom mic stand seemed sturdy enough to handle any mic that I throw at it. The 18 Samson XLR mic cable, mic clip, and windscreen were icing on the cake. 

One of my favorite features of this kit is undoubtedly its adjustability. I can adjust the height and angle of the boom mic stand to my liking, making my recording sessions more comfortable than ever. However, there's also a downside to this flexibility - I occasionally experience some wobbling if I make the arm too long. 

As for the cons, the only one worth mentioning is that the stand could've been slightly heavier for added stability. But considering its portability, I believe it's an acceptable trade-off. 

In conclusion, the Samson - MK5 (Boom Microphone Kit) has truly revolutionized my recording process, making me sound as professional as I look. 


### [Blue Yeti Blackout Microphone with Accessories](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=blue-yeti-blackout-microphone-with-accessories)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=blue-yeti-microphone-blackout-with-boom-arm-stand-pop-filter-and-shock-mount-1"><img alt="blue-yeti-microphone-blackout-with-boom-arm-stand-pop-filter-and-shock-mount-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blue-yeti-microphone-blackout-with-boom-arm-stand-pop-filter-and-shock-mount-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Blue Yeti Microphone with Boom Arm Stand, Pop Filter, and Shock Mount for my home office. I was in the market for a high-quality microphone to enhance my online communication and streaming activities. This product did not disappoint! 

From the moment I unboxed it, I could see that the build quality was excellent. The metal construction of the boom arm and the heft of the microphone itself gives it a solid and professional feel. The blackout design looks sleek and modern on my desktop. 

One key feature that has made a significant difference is the noise reduction. My previous microphone picked up every little sound in the room, making it challenging to communicate clearly. With the Blue Yeti, I can speak confidently knowing that my voice is the only thing coming through. 

Another highlight is the ease of use. Simply plugging it into my computer's USB port allowed me to start using it immediately. The intuitive controls on the microphone make adjusting the settings effortless. 

However, there are a couple of minor cons to consider. First, the boom arm could be longer to provide more flexibility in positioning. Second, the pop filter could be made from sturdier material, as it felt a bit flimsy. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Blue Yeti Microphone. The sound quality is exceptional, and the design is both stylish and functional. For anyone in the market for a high-quality USB microphone, I would highly recommend the Blue Yeti! 


### [Detachable Boom Microphone for ISOtunes Link 2.0 Earmuffs](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=detachable-boom-microphone-for-isotunes-link-20-earmuffs)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=isotunes-it-85-detachable-boom-microphone-for-link-2-1"><img alt="isotunes-it-85-detachable-boom-microphone-for-link-2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/isotunes-it-85-detachable-boom-microphone-for-link-2-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got introduced to ISOtunes IT-85, a detachable boom microphone that's designed to be used with the Link 2.0 earmuffs. My first impression of its matte black design was quite appealing, and it had a noise-reducing boom attached for clear calls even in the loudest environments. As soon as I plugged it in, I noticed the difference, especially during those heated moments when I wanted to make phone calls without distractions. 

One of the features that really stood out for me was the adjustable boom, which helped me get the perfect fit. Additionally, the replacement windscreen offered great flexibility in usage. However, using it for extended periods can lead to a slightly uncomfortable feel due to the earmuff fit. 

Overall, the ISOtunes IT-85 has been a reliable companion for work. Its noise reduction and ability to maintain clear communication in noisy environments really impresses me. It's perfect if you're looking for a device that allows you to enjoy your music and attend calls without any disturbances. It's not only comfortable but also has a sleek design. If the earmuff's fit could be improved on, the ISOtunes IT-85 would be perfect. 


### [High-Performance Shotgun Microphone](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=high-performance-shotgun-microphone)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=sennheiser-mke-600-shotgun-microphone-1"><img alt="sennheiser-mke-600-shotgun-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sennheiser-mke-600-shotgun-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Sennheiser MKE 600 Shotgun Microphone for a while now, and I must say, it's my go-to camera microphone for capturing great sound. This little powerhouse packs a punch with its high directivity, effectively filtering out unwanted noise from the sides and rear. The switchable Low Cut filter has been a life-saver when working in windy conditions. 

One thing I love about this microphone is its versatility. Since it can be battery powered, it's perfect for situations where phantom power isn't an option. Plus, the battery on/off switch prevents any premature discharging. And speaking of batteries, the long battery life has been incredibly helpful – I never have to worry about running out of juice mid-shoot! 

However, as good as the MKE 600 is, it does have its quirks. It can be quite picky about positioning due to its high gain requirements. This might not be a problem for some, but for those who work with varying shot sizes, it can be quite the challenge. 

In conclusion, the Sennheiser MKE 600 Shotgun Microphone has been an excellent addition to my gear. Its great sound quality, build quality, and portability make it a top choice for video camera projects. The minor issue with its gain sensitivity is not a deal-breaker for me, but it's definitely worth considering depending on your shooting style and requirements. 


### [360 Degree Rotatable Adjustable Microphone Boom Arm Stand](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=360-degree-rotatable-adjustable-microphone-boom-arm-stand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=adjustable-360-rotatable-microphone-boom-arm-1"><img alt="adjustable-360-rotatable-microphone-boom-arm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/adjustable-360-rotatable-microphone-boom-arm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the I-Xtech's adjustable 360° rotatable microphone boom arm for a few weeks now and it's been quite an experience! Imagine setting up your recording studio or podcasting setup with ease, without having to deal with tangled cables or shaky mics – that's what this boom arm offers. 

This steel-constructed beast has no problem handling my heavy SM7B microphone, and its 360-degree rotation allows me to adjust the mic exactly where I need it, making it perfect for live DJing, voiceovers, and recording music tracks. The internal suspension springs ensure a quiet, smooth operation, and the sleek design is definitely a bonus. 

One of my favorite features is the smart cable management clip-on holder, which keeps all my cables neatly organized and off my desk. The folding scissor arm helps save space when not in use, making it easy to carry around or store. 

However, assembly wasn't exactly a breeze. The instructions could have been clearer, and I found myself referring to online videos to help put everything together properly. Additionally, I was a little disappointed that one end of the box was already opened when it arrived. But overall, the quality and performance of this boom arm have definitely lived up to my expectations. 

So, if you're looking for a reliable boom arm to elevate your recording experience, I highly recommend giving the I-Xtech's adjustable 360° rotatable microphone boom arm a try! 


### [Versatile Hercules Boom Microphone and Camera Arm](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=versatile-hercules-boom-microphone-and-camera-arm)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=hercules-dg107b-universal-boom-arm-1"><img alt="hercules-dg107b-universal-boom-arm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hercules-dg107b-universal-boom-arm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently upgraded my podcasting equipment with the Hercules DG107B Podcast Microphone and Camera Arm, and I couldn't be happier. This boom arm is sleek, easy to use, and incredibly versatile. I was especially impressed by the tight vice locking mechanism, which ensures that my microphone stays firmly in place no matter how much movement there is during a session. 

The DG107B is compatible with a variety of thread adapter options for 1/4", 3/8", and 5/8", allowing me to hold multiple types of microphones and cameras. Its wider support range also means I can use it on different surfaces, including my desk and a nearby microphone stand. 

One thing that sets this boom arm apart from others is its cable management system. The DG107B comes with three Hercules cable wraps, which have been a game-changer in keeping my workspace looking neat and professional. 

However, some users have reported that the desk clamp may not fit all desks, so it's worth checking the dimensions before purchasing. Overall, though, I highly recommend the Hercules DG107B for anyone looking to improve their podcasting or streaming setup. 


### [PMKSM20 Dynamic Microphone & Tripod Stand with Extending Boom & Cable](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/boom-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=boom-microphones&utm_term=pmksm20-dynamic-microphone-tripod-stand-with-extending-boom-cable)

However, I did notice that the build quality could be improved. The wire frame isn't as sturdy as I'd like it to be, which can lead to some discomfort during long performances. 

Another issue I had was with the size adjustment. The lack of customizable head sizes can make it difficult for different performers to find the right fit. But overall, this microphone offers great value for its price and works well with most belt pack systems. 

In conclusion, the Pyle PLM31 Cardioid Condenser Headset Microphone is a good choice if you're looking for a budget-friendly microphone that delivers on sound quality. Just be prepared to handle it with care and maybe invest in some additional support for the wire frame.

The foam windshield on the XM-55 does an excellent job at keeping my recordings clear and noise-free, even when I'm filming outdoors.

It's perfect for capturing dialogues and voices clearly, making it a great choice for videographers and podcasters alike. However, it's worth noting that some reviewers have mentioned that the microphone can be quite noisy and lack sensitivity when it comes to subtle details.

## FAQ



### What is a boom microphone?

A boom microphone, also known as a boom mic, is a type of microphone typically mounted on a boom pole or boom arm. It is designed to capture sound from a distance, making it ideal for capturing dialogue in film and television productions, live events, and video recordings. The main advantage of using a boom microphone is its ability to position the microphone closer to the source without being visible in the frame, which helps reduce background noise and improve audio quality. 


### How do boom microphones work?

Boom microphones work by transmitting the vibrations of sound waves emitted from a source. When the sound waves make contact with the microphone's diaphragm, it produces an electrical signal, which is then processed and amplified to produce clear audio. Some boom microphones require external power sources (like phantom power) to function, while others can operate on battery power. 



### What types of microphones can be used on a boom?

Various types of microphones can be mounted on a boom pole, but the most common ones are condenser microphones. Condenser mics are known for their high sensitivity and ability to capture subtle audio nuances, making them ideal for capturing dialogues in films or capturing audio during live performances. Other types of microphones, such as dynamic microphones or ribbon microphones, can also be mounted on a boom pole, but they are typically less flexible and have a narrower frequency response compared to condenser microphones. 


### How should a boom microphone be positioned for optimal audio quality?

To achieve optimal audio quality with a boom microphone, the following factors must be considered: * Proximity: The microphone should be positioned as close to the source as possible while remaining out of the camera frame.

* Polar pattern: Depending on the context and the desired audio effect, microphones with cardioid, supercardioid, or hypercardioid polar patterns can be selected to control the directionality of the microphone's audio pickup pattern.

* Shielding: Depending on the environment, using windscreens and pop filters can help reduce unwanted noise from the wind, breath, or other sources.



### What is phantom power and do I need it for my boom microphone?

Phantom power is a method of providing electrical power to condenser microphones through their XLR connection. Some condenser microphones require phantom power to operate as they do not have built-in batteries. If you are using a condenser boom microphone that requires phantom power, you will need a preamplifier or audio interface that supports phantom power. 


### How do I choose the best boom microphone for my needs?

When choosing a boom microphone, consider the following factors: 1. Usage: Determine the primary use of the microphone, such as film production, live event, or videography.

2. Polar pattern: Different environments and sound sources may require different microphone polar patterns to achieve the desired audio quality.

3. Frequency response: Choosing a microphone with a frequency response that complements your audio source will help you achieve the best sound quality.

4. Sensitivity: Depending on the proximity of your microphone to the source, you may need a microphone with higher or lower sensitivity to ensure optimal signal-to-noise ratio.

5. Price: Set a budget and choose a microphone that offers the best value within that price range.


### How do I set up a boom microphone for professional use?

To set up a boom microphone for professional use, consider the following: * Select an appropriate boom pole or boom arm, considering the desired length and portability.

* Choose a suitable microphone based on your intended use, considering factors such as frequency response, sensitivity, and polar pattern.

* Attach the microphone to the boom pole or boom arm securely using appropriate clamps or rubber bands, ensuring that the microphone point towards the source without touching any surfaces or obstacles.

* Connect the microphone to a preamplifier or audio interface that supports your microphone's connection type (such as XLR or TRS) and provides necessary power (phantom or battery).

* Adjust the microphone's position and distance from the source to optimize audio quality, considering factors such as the desired audio effect, background noise, and visual framing.
