I recently got my hands on the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my home studio! This condenser microphone provides studio-quality articulation, allowing me to record music with ease. What I love about this microphone is its USB connectivity, which makes it incredibly easy to connect with my computer and compatible recording software. 

The cardioid condenser design of the AT2020 USB is another standout feature, as it helps in canceling out unwanted noise and focusing on the desired sound.

Now, on to some cons. One issue I've noticed is that the microphone can be quite sensitive, so it's essential to place it in a quiet environment or use a noise gate when recording.

In conclusion, the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB offers a fantastic balance of sound quality and ease of use, making it a top choice for home recording enthusiasts. With its USB connectivity and cardioid condenser design, it's a reliable and versatile microphone that delivers professional results.

## Buyer's Guide



### Important Features to Consider

When buying an Audio-Technica microphone, there are several features that you should look into: 

* Polar Pattern: This refers to the directionality of the microphone, which can be unidirectional (cardioid) or omnidirectional. Depending on your recording needs, consider whether you prefer a microphone with a narrow or wide pickup pattern.

* Sensitivity: This is how much a microphone can capture subtle sounds. For louder environments, opt for a less sensitive microphone; if you need to capture nuanced, quieter sounds, choose a highly sensitive one.

* Frequency Response: This is the range of frequencies that the microphone can reproduce accurately. Think about what kind of sounds or voice you will be recording with your microphone, as specific frequencies are optimal for different types of audio.

* Sturdiness and Durability: Invest in a microphone that is built to last. Consider its overall build quality and design, as well as whether it comes with any protective features (like a windscreen or pop filter).


### Considerations and Advice

To help you make the best choice, here are some general tips for choosing an Audio-Technica microphone: 

1. Identify Your Needs: Carefully assess the environment where you'll be using the microphone and the type of audio you want to record. This will guide you in picking the right features for your specific situation.

2. Budget: Audio-Technica offers microphones at various price points. Determine how much you're willing to spend, while considering the quality you expect from the device.

3. Reviews: Check both professional and customer reviews to get a sense of how other consumers have fared with different models and to learn about any potential issues that might affect your experience.

4. Support and Warranty: Make sure to consider the manufacturer's after-sales support and warranty options. In case of any malfunction or damage, having a reliable support system and warranty coverage can save you time and money in the long run.



### Conclusion

Choosing the right audio technology is crucial to capturing high-quality sound. By keeping these key features, considerations, and advice in mind, you'll be able to make an informed decision when selecting an Audio-Technica microphone to fit your needs and budget. Always remember to invest in a device that offers the best combination of performance, durability, and value for your specific audio-recording goals. 


## FAQ



### What are the main types of Audio-Technica microphones?

Audio-Technica offers a variety of microphones, including dynamic, condenser, and ribbon microphones. Dynamic microphones are versatile and suitable for live performances and recordings, while condenser microphones are excellent for studio recordings. Ribbon microphones, although less common, provide a warm and natural sound quality. 


### How do I choose the right microphone for my needs?

Consider factors such as your intended use, the environment, and your budget. Dynamic microphones are a good choice for live performances or recordings with a louder sound source, while condenser microphones are ideal for capturing subtle nuances in a studio setting. Ribbon microphones are known for their vintage sound quality but require a higher budget. 



### What is the difference between a cardioid and a supercardioid microphone?

Cardioid microphones have a "heart-shaped" pickup pattern that primarily captures sound coming from the front and some side audio, minimizing background noise. Supercardioid microphones have a more directional pattern, offering a narrower front focus with reduced side capture, providing even better noise rejection. The supercardioid microphone is ideal for reducing feedback in live performance settings. 


### How do I properly set up an Audio-Technica microphone?

Begin by carefully attaching the microphone to its stand and ensuring it is secure. For condenser microphones, connect the microphone to the phantom power source or mixer to provide power. Next, set the gain (input) level to an appropriate level to prevent clipping or lack of sensitivity. Finally, use the mixer or preamp to adjust the equalizer, compressor, and any other desired effects. 



### How do I maintain and clean my Audio-Technica microphone?

Regular care and maintenance are essential for keeping your microphone in optimal condition. Always store the microphone in a protective case or pouch when not in use. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or moisture. To clean the microphone, gently use a soft brush (such as a paintbrush) to remove loose debris, and then use a microfiber cloth to wipe the surface. Avoid using any solvents or cleaners, as they may damage the microphone's components. 


### How do I troubleshoot common microphone issues?

If the microphone is producing a buzzing sound, ensure that it is properly grounded and that the power source is functioning correctly. For condenser microphones, check the phantom power source, as it could be too high or too low. To correct feedback issues, adjust the microphone's position, aim it away from monitors, or use a noise gate or notch filter to isolate frequencies causing the problem. For any other issues, consult the user manual or contact Audio-Technica customer support.
