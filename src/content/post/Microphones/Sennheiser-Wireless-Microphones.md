Depending on your location you can operate up to 32 mics in one space. 

The plug-on transmitter attaches to a handheld microphone of your choice for man-on-the-street interviews or to a shotgun mic for wireless booming (both types of mics are available separately). It also provides 48V phantom power giving you the option to use a condenser microphone. The camera-mount receiver connects to a camcorder, a DSLR/mirrorless or a cinema camera to capture crisp-sounding speech or dialog for projects ranging from films and documentaries to wedding videos, corporate spots and mobile journalism. 

The EW 500 BOOM G4 is backward-compatible with previous evolution systems including EW 100 models giving you the ability to mix and match G4/G3/G2/G1 receivers or bodypack handheld and plug-on transmitters. "

The wireless connectivity is incredibly dependable. I've tried this at different venues and distances from the receiver, and I've never experienced any dropouts or interference. It's allowed me to focus on my performance without worrying about technical issues.

Additionally, the charging process could be made more convenient by including a charging station or multi-battery charger. 

In terms of sound quality, the AVX-MKE2 is definitely a winner. The microphone itself is incredibly sensitive and captures clear, crisp audio, making it a great choice for both professional broadcasters and everyday users who want to improve the quality of their home recordings.

First off, the sound quality was phenomenal. The high-grade MKE 2 omnidirectional lavalier mic did an excellent job of capturing clear, crisp audio without any interference. It's rugged build also ensured that it could withstand the rigors of my shooting environment. 

Setting up the system was incredibly easy. Its user-friendly interface meant that I could switch frequencies and operate the system with minimal effort, saving me time and helping me focus on my subjects. 

The construction of the bodypack transmitter and camera-mount receiver was impressive too. They felt sturdy and well-built in my hands, a sure sign of durability that would last me many shooting projects.
