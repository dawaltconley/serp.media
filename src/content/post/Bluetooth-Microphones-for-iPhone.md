While the Mini Mic Pro's battery life is quite commendable, charging it with the USB-C connector was a breeze. The fact that it's compatible with both iPhones and Android devices made it incredibly convenient for me to use across different platforms. 

However, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the wireless range could be better. Although it claims to provide a reliable signal up to 300 feet away, I noticed some minor interference issues when I was more than 100 feet from my recording device.
