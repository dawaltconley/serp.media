Whenever I was on a mission to create the perfect gaming lair, one element that never seemed to disappoint was a desk sporting sleek LED lights. The Bestier gaming desk with shelves is a shining example of a product that gets the job done, with 4 tiers of reversible shelving for a myriad of gaming essentials. However, the LED light system really takes things to the next level. 

What struck me the most about this desk is the level of customization it provides. Not only can you adjust the height of the top shelf to suit your gaming tower, but you can also change up the placement of the reversible shelves according to your preferences. And let's not forget about the side storage bag for your cables and the hooks for stowing away accessories. 

The sturdiness of the desk is commendable as well. The CARB P2 Class Board is a premium-quality material that's easy to assemble with the help of a clear manual and installation video. The addition of a durable steel frame with an X-crossbar only adds to the desk's durability and stability. 

However, my gaming experience was slightly marred by the delivery condition of the desk, which arrived smashed up. The customer service was less than helpful when I tried to return the product. It felt like a kicker to an otherwise stellar gaming desk.

The adjustable height of the bottom shelf is a major plus as well. Being able to tailor the desk to fit my gaming setup perfectly just adds to the overall fantastic user experience. Plus, the durable steel construction is simply a win in my books. 

However, the lighting feature could use a bit of updating. The choice of colors is a bit limited, and the overall control experience is a bit clunky. On the other hand, the reversible shelves offer a great personal touch to the desk layout. 

In conclusion, this gaming desk is definitely a must-have for any serious gamer who values both form and function in their gaming setup. It's a true winner, with just a couple of minor quibbles.
