<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/mouse-pad-black-and-white?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=mouse-pad-black-and-white&amp;utm_term=xxl-gaming-mouse-pad-with-cherry-blossom-print-and-waterproof-coating"><img alt="gaming-mouse-pad-black-and-white-cherry-blossom-xxl-xl-large-mouse-pad-mat-long-extended-mousepad-de-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaming-mouse-pad-black-and-white-cherry-blossom-xxl-xl-large-mouse-pad-mat-long-extended-mousepad-de-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out this Black and White Cherry Blossom XXL Mouse Pad, and I must say, it's a game-changer for both work and play. The XXL size is perfect for fitting my mouse, keyboard, and other desk essentials, making my workspace feel more organized and efficient. And, the non-slip rubber base is a lifesaver – no more annoying mouse pad movement while I'm deep into a gaming session or focused on my work. 

One feature that really stood out to me is the waterproof coating. Accidents happen, and it's always nice to know that my mouse pad can handle spills without getting damaged. Plus, it's easy to clean – a simple wipe with a wet cloth and it's as good as new. 

However, there are a couple of downsides that I noticed. Despite its durability, it does weigh quite a bit, which can be a hassle to move around. Additionally, while the stitched edges look neat, they can be a bit of a pain to clean when there are any spills near them. 

Overall, I'm happy with my experience using this Extended Gaming Mouse Pad. It's comfortable, durable, and provides the perfect blend of speed and control for both gaming and office work. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the benefits definitely outweigh them.

I was searching for a gaming mouse pad that could accommodate my large mouse, and the Black White Striped Gaming Mouse Pad XL from Wallacely seemed like a perfect fit. The size of 31.5 x 11.8 inches really impressed me, and the non-slip rubber base ensured a secure hold for my gaming sessions. 

This mouse pad is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, with its black and white striped design. But what really made a difference for me were the stitched edges that provided that extra durability I was seeking. The 6mm lockrand and 3mm thickness perfectly suited my needs, offering a seamless gliding surface for my mouse. 

However, while I absolutely love the design, I did find the mouse pad a bit too large for my work setup, and sometimes, my mouse would accidentally slip off the edges. Despite this minor inconvenience, the Black White Striped Gaming Mouse Pad XL from Wallacely has become a staple in my gaming and work setup, providing a high-quality user experience.

The easy-to-clean feature of this mouse pad is a lifesaver. A simple wipe with a wet cloth or paper does the job. It's also washable and foldable without leaving creases, making it easy to carry and store when needed. Additionally, the spill-proof coating protects my desktop from a variety of liquids that can potentially damage it.
