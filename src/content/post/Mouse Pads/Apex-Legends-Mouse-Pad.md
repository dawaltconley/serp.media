### [XL Gaming Mouse Pad with Unique Speed and Control](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/apex-legends-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&utm_content=apex-legends-mouse-pad&utm_term=xl-gaming-mouse-pad-with-unique-speed-and-control)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/apex-legends-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=apex-legends-mouse-pad&amp;utm_term=xl-gaming-mouse-pad-with-unique-speed-and-control"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-slim-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-slim-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on Glorious' XL Slim mousepad and have been using it every day since then. The white color fits perfectly with my setup and the large surface area gives me plenty of room to maneuver my mouse. 

The most noticeable aspect of this mousepad is the stitched edges, ensuring the edges do not fray and the pad maintains its shape. It's definitely a plus for the aesthetics, giving the pad a luxurious look. However, the most impressive feature is the surface. It provides an ideal blend of speed and control, making it perfect for any game scenario, from precision aiming in a first-person shooter to fast-paced strategic maneuvers. 

Unfortunately, in my daily use, I've discovered that the non-slip rubber base doesn't seem to hold up as well as I hoped. Although it's not a deal-breaker, I've noticed the pad occasionally slides around my desk, which can be a minor inconvenience. 

On the plus side, the pad is machine washable, which is a huge plus for those who need a quick clean-up. However, I had to be a bit cautious with this as the first wash resulted in some color loss, turning the pad a bit grey instead of the white shade I initially enjoyed. 

The price-point is reasonable for what you get, it's more of a premium product since it comes from Glorious. Overall, if you're in the market for a large-sized, smooth gliding mouse pad that can handle high-speed gaming action, then this Glorious product is worth checking out. Just remember to consider the potential for color loss with the first wash! 


### [Stylish Mid-Size Mouse Pad for Apex Legends Gamers](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/apex-legends-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&utm_content=apex-legends-mouse-pad&utm_term=stylish-mid-size-mouse-pad-for-apex-legends-gamers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/apex-legends-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=apex-legends-mouse-pad&amp;utm_term=stylish-mid-size-mouse-pad-for-apex-legends-gamers"><img alt="nzxt-mxp700-mid-size-extended-mouse-pad-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nzxt-mxp700-mid-size-extended-mouse-pad-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a gamer, the NZXT MXP700 Mid-Size Extended Mouse Pad quickly became an essential part of my gaming setup. The pad's dimensions were just right for my full-sized keyboard and mouse, allowing me to effortlessly navigate through Apex Legends or any other game without any hindrance. 

The sleek gray color and silk surface material added a touch of elegance to my gaming station, making it feel more professional and organized. The low-friction surface allowed for quick and precise movements, giving me the edge I needed when facing off against my opponents. 

One downside, however, was the slight stinky smell that came with the pad when I first received it. But fortunately, it faded away after a few days. Another minor drawback was the ease with which it got stained, so I had to be cautious with spills or any accidental stains. 

Overall, the NZXT MXP700 Mid-Size Extended Mouse Pad was a great addition to my gaming experience, providing exceptional comfort, grip, and a visually appealing design. And at an affordable price, it was a steal for the quality and features it offered.

When I first got my hands on this League of Legends Gamer Mouse Pad, I was immediately drawn to the intricate Hextech Logo, reflecting my love for the game. Its 3mm thickness made it comfortable to use and didn't hinder my mouse movements at all. The high-quality printing process ensured that the design stayed vibrant, and the pad was compatible with optical and laser mice, which was a bonus. 

Although the product description mentioned a 30-day return policy, I didn't have to utilize it as it exceeded my expectations. The return policy gave me the confidence to purchase other gaming accessories from ABYstyle in the future. I appreciated how customer-focused DeinDeal was, making it 24/7 accessible and updating their offers regularly to keep customers engaged and satisfied.

I recently tried the SteelSeries QcK XXL Gaming Mouse Pad and was quite impressed with its performance. The exclusive QcK micro-woven cloth provided excellent control, making it a top choice for competitive gamers like me. The surface was optimized for both low and high CPI tracking movements, so my mouse glided smoothly across it without any issues. 

The durability and washability of the QcK XXL were also noteworthy features. Despite being used for long gaming sessions, it has been easy to clean and maintain. The top choice of esports pros for over 15 years speaks to its reliability and effectiveness, and I can see why. 

However, I did notice that the product comes with a Proposition 65 warning, which may seem concerning to some potential buyers. Nonetheless, I believe the benefits of the QcK XXL Gaming Mouse Pad outweigh the potential drawbacks.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/apex-legends-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=apex-legends-mouse-pad&amp;utm_term=steelseries-qck-heavy-apex-legends-mouse-pad-with-6mm-thickness-and-non-slip-base"><img alt="steelseries-qck-heavy-mouse-pad-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/steelseries-qck-heavy-mouse-pad-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the SteelSeries QcK heavy mouse pad for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my daily gaming sessions. The first thing that caught my attention was its size - it's a monster among mouse pads! It has a non-slip rubber base that ensures it stays put on any surface, providing a stable foundation for my mouse movements. 

The heavy thickness of the pad gives it a unique feel, setting it apart from other SteelSeries mouse pads I've used. While it's not as spongy as some might prefer, I personally appreciate the balance it strikes between speed and control. The micro-woven cloth offers maximum control over low and high CPI tracking movements, resulting in a gaming experience with exceptional precision. 

One downside I've experienced is the texture of the pad. It took some time to get used to, but now I actually find it to be quite comfortable. The exclusive QcK fabric provides a smooth and sleek surface that not only feels nice but also looks great. 

Overall, the SteelSeries QcK heavy mouse pad provides a solid and durable gaming surface with optimal tracking and a unique, heavy feel. Although the texture can be a bit of an adjustment, I've grown to appreciate this aspect of the pad. It's definitely worth considering, especially if you're looking to upgrade your current mouse pad.

The smooth, micro-woven cloth surface allows my mouse to glide effortlessly, ensuring precise tracking and control, even during high-speed gaming sessions. 

One of the standout features of this mousepad is its durability. The non-slip rubber base keeps it firmly in place, even when I'm deep in the heat of battle. It's also washable, which is a massive plus since I can simply pop it in the laundry and have it looking as good as new in no time. 

However, there's one aspect of the QcK Cloth Gaming Mousepad that I'd like to see improved. While the thickness of the pad provides a comfortable experience, it can be a bit heavy for some users. Nonetheless, this is a minor issue compared to the overall excellence of the product. 

In conclusion, the SteelSeries QcK Cloth Gaming Mousepad is an exceptional choice for gamers and office workers alike.

I recently added this Transcendence Gaming Mouse Pad to my gaming setup, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer! The vibrant prints on this 100% polyester, non-slip surface are truly eye-catching, and the rubber base ensures it won't budge during intense gaming sessions.

However, there was one downside I experienced - the sizing. Although the mouse pad comes in two sizes, figuring out the right one for my gaming setup was a bit tricky, as there doesn't seem to be any specific guide indicating which size corresponds to which height and thickness combination.

However, there were a couple of downsides that I noticed. The size of the mouse pad might seem ideal at first, but it can be a bit too big for some desk setups. Additionally, the non-slip surface works well most of the time, but after prolonged gaming sessions, it can start to wear off a little.

I recently tried out the Glorious XL Gaming Mouse Mat Pad, and it was a game-changer for my desktop setup! Not only do I enjoy playing Apex Legends, but I also wanted a mouse pad that would enhance my gaming experience while looking sleek on my desk. The Glorious mouse mat was an excellent choice for that. 

The first thing I noticed about this mouse pad was its impressive size - it truly is an XL mat, providing ample space for my mouse to glide smoothly across the surface. The 2-3mm thickness makes it the perfect balance between a solid base and a cushioned feel, ensuring optimal control and responsiveness during intense gaming sessions. My fingers really appreciated the resistance felt in each swift movement, which helped land those crucial headshots with ease. 

The black smooth cloth surface not only looked great on my desk, but also performed exceptionally well when it came to the glide factor. The non-slip rubber base kept my mouse pad firmly in place, preventing any unwanted slippage or movement while in action. I was especially impressed with the anti-fraying stitched frame, which not only gave the mat a sleek and professional appearance, but also significantly increased its overall durability. 

One feature I particularly loved about the Glorious XL Gaming Mouse Mat Pad was its machine-washable design. As someone who spends hours each day gaming and typing, my mouse pad would often accumulate dirt, dust, and even various stains. Being able to easily pop it in the washing machine and have it look as good as new in a matter of minutes was a lifesaver. 

Of course, no product is perfect, and I did encounter a few minor drawbacks. The mat's surface does tend to pick up smudges and stains more quickly than I would have liked, but with regular cleaning, it was still easy to maintain its pristine look. Additionally, while some customers reported a strong chemical smell when opening the package, my unit arrived with only a subtle fragrance that quickly dissipated. 

All in all, the Glorious XL Gaming Mouse Mat Pad greatly enhanced my gaming experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a premium and beautifully designed mouse pad. It's sturdy, comfortable, and easy to keep clean, making it a fantastic investment for any competitive gamer or PC enthusiast. 


## Buyer's Guide

While playing Apex Legends, controlling your character effectively and accurately using a mouse is crucial. However, to achieve that, you need a good quality mouse pad that provides the right surface for your fingers to glide smoothly. In this buyer's guide, we'll go over the important factors to consider when purchasing an Apex Legends mouse pad. 


### Surface Material


One of the most important aspects of a mouse pad is its surface material. Gaming mouse pads typically have two main materials: cloth/fabric and hard/plastic surfaces. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages. Cloth surfaces are generally smoother and less noisy than plastic surfaces, but they might not be as accurate for some users. On the other hand, hard surfaces provide more accurate tracking and can handle higher DPI settings better, but they can be louder and less comfortable to use on a long gaming session. 


### Size and Shape

The size and shape of your mouse pad are also important factors to consider. Standard mouse pad sizes range from 8x10 inches to 12x18 inches. Larger mouse pads can provide more space and give you the freedom to move your mouse more freely. As for the shape, there are two common designs: rectangular and oval. Rectangular pads work with most desks and provide a more stable surface. Oval shapes offer more ergonomic comfort and support for your wrist. 


### Grip and Anti-Fray Technology

A good grip or anti-fray technology can prevent your mouse pad from slipping or tearing over time. There are various ways mouse pad manufacturers achieve this, such as rubber backing, adhesive strips, and reinforced edges. Make sure to check for these features when purchasing a mouse pad, as they can ensure a comfortable and long-lasting gaming experience. 



### Price and Brand

Finally, consider the price and brand of the mouse pad. More reputable brands usually offer better quality, durability, and features. However, this doesn't always mean you have to spend more money. Look for the best balance between price and quality based on your needs and budget. 


### Wrap Up

Choosing the perfect Apex Legends mouse pad can greatly enhance your gaming experience. Consider the surface material, size and shape, grip and anti-fray technology, and price and brand when making your decision. As you start your search for the perfect mouse pad, remember that finding the right balance between all these factors is key.
