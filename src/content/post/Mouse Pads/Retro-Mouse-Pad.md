I recently started using the EKOBLA Retro Floral Mouse Pad and love how it adds a touch of vintage charm to my workspace. The 9.5x7.9-inch rectangular design fits perfectly in front of my laptop, and the non-slip rubber base ensures it stays put even during intense gaming sessions. 

The captivating floral theme, featuring a lush array of peonies, wildflowers, leaves, and oriental motifs, enhances the aesthetic appeal of my desk. However, I noticed that the thick mouse pad might be a little too heavy for some people's preference. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, the EKOBLA Retro Floral Mouse Pad has become an essential addition to my daily gaming routine.

I recently stumbled upon this Retro 70s 60s Floral Hippie Mushroom desk mat by Yashilaiya. I must say, the design is quite an eye-catcher, brightening up my dull office space. This large gaming mouse mat has a non-slip rubber base that stays firm during use, preventing any unwanted movement. 

The waterproof surface comes in handy when accidents happen, making clean-up a breeze. It's also great to know I can roll it up and carry it with me to the office or even on business trips. The perfect writing surface allows me to use it comfortably, making it great for extended typing sessions. 

One feature I really appreciate is the durability of the stitched edges. They protect the mat from wear, deformation, and degumming in prolonged use. The package includes just one mouse pad, and don't worry, the material smell will fade over time, leaving you with a top-notch workspace accessory.

I recently came across this eye-catching 80's retro mouse pad and decided to give it a try. The first thing that stood out to me was its thick, 0.22-inch design, making it a far cry from the flimsy options I've used in the past. Its dimensions of 7.75 inches by 9.25 inches also provided a generous workspace for my mouse movements. 

The polyester surface was a nice touch, as it added a bit of texture and grip to the pad, keeping my mouse in place during use. However, the black rubber backing didn't quite live up to my expectations. Despite its black color, it seemed to pick up dust and lint quite easily, requiring frequent cleaning. 

Overall, this retro mouse pad made a fun and unique addition to my workspace. Its thickness and texture offered a comfortable experience, but the maintenance it required was somewhat frustrating. Whether you're a fan of the 80's aesthetic or simply looking for a durable mouse pad, this option may be worth considering.

As someone who has used this Retro Ouija Board Mouse Pad for a few weeks now, I must say, it's been a fantastic addition to my home office. The soft-touch surface is a dream to use, and it has held up perfectly without any cracking or peeling, just like the description promised. The unique Ouija Board design not only adds a fun, retro touch to my workspace but also gets compliments from friends and family who visit. 

What stands out to me the most is the smoothness of the mouse pad's cloth surface. It feels effortless to glide my mouse over, providing excellent control and comfort during my workday. The hard cover case also brings a practical yet stylish touch, and I appreciate that it still allows full access to all my device's buttons and speakers. 

A couple of minor issues I've noticed are that it's a bit smaller than I initially anticipated, but it hasn't affected its functionality. Another downside is that the thinness of the mouse pad might require some extra care to keep it in top shape. Overall, though, this Retro Ouija Board Mouse Pad has been a delight to use, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to elevate their desk setup with a touch of fun and style!
