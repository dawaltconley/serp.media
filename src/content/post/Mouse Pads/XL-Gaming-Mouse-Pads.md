I appreciate that it doesn't have that peculiar smell, which is often found in cheaper alternatives. 

One of my favorite aspects of this mouse pad is its size. Being an extra-large long extended mat, it covers a vast area and provides a personalized experience to my workspace. The unique design not only sets my desk apart from others but also makes it more comfortable to use while typing. 

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks that I've experienced. For one, while the mouse pad is relatively thick, it doesn't offer exceptional precision and smoothness while using it. Additionally, the Sea Wave Japanese Art Mouse Pad is not specifically designed for gaming, despite its large size. 

Overall, if you're looking for a comfortable, breathable, and stylish mouse pad to upgrade your workspace, the Sea Wave Japanese Art Mouse Pad could be an excellent option. Just be aware that it might not provide the same level of precision and smoothness as a gaming mouse pad.
