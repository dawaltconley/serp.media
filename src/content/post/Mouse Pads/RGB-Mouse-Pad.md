I recently tried out the Bimormat RGB Mouse Pad LED Light gaming mouse pad and let me tell you, it's definitely a unique and stylish addition to any gamer's setup. First off, the extra-large size made it perfect for my mouse, keyboard, and even my smartphone. The smooth, waterproof surface made gaming a breeze, and the RGB lighting modes added an immersive touch to my gaming experience. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed. The natural rubber base took a little longer to arrive in the package compared to others, but once it arrived, I just had to leave it out for a day or two to fully settle. Also, even though it's waterproof, I found myself taking more precautions to avoid any accidental spills. 

Overall, I had a great time using this mouse pad. Its size, smooth surface, and vibrant lighting provided me with a comfortable and visually stunning gaming experience.
