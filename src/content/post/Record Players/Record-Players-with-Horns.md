Using this upgraded Angels Horn turntable in my daily life has been nothing short of fantastic. The sound quality is crystal clear and it easily connects to my Bluetooth speaker for hands-free listening. The build quality is sturdy and the belt-driven 2-speed mechanism is smooth. 

One particular feature that stood out was the adjustable counterweight, allowing for precise alignment of my vinyl records. However, I do wish the instruction manual was more detailed for those new to turntables. Additionally, I would have appreciated a more eco-friendly power option as the device consumes 5 watts of electricity. 

Despite these minor setbacks, I'm really pleased with my Angels Horn turntable. It's a charming addition to my home, and it truly brings my vinyl collection back to life.

## Buyer's Guide

Record players with horns have been a popular choice for music lovers for decades. They offer an immersive listening experience that traditional speakers simply cannot match. Whether you're a seasoned audiophile or new to the world of hi-fi, understanding some key features and considerations can help you make an informed decision when choosing a record player with horns. 



### Importance of Bass Horns

Bass horns are an essential component of record players with horns. They provide a deep, rich bass tone that adds to the overall listening experience. When considering a record player with horns, make sure it has good quality bass horns that can handle low frequencies without distortion or unnecessary vibrations. 


### Driver Design and Placement

The driver design and placement can greatly affect the sound quality of a record player with horns. Look for models with high-quality drivers, such as aluminum or cast-iron cones, and neodymium magnets. The drivers should be correctly positioned within the horn to ensure proper sound dispersion and prevent sound distortion. Additionally, consider the crossover design to ensure smooth frequency transitions between the different drivers. 



### Power Requirements

Record players with horns require a good amount of power to drive their high-quality drivers. Make sure the amplifier or integrated system you choose has the necessary wattage to deliver a strong, clear sound. It's also important to consider the power handling of the speakers themselves to ensure they can handle the output without distortion. 


### Durable Construction

Since record players with horns are usually larger and heavier than their conventional counterparts, it's crucial to choose a model with robust construction. Look for sturdy cabinets, high-quality materials, and components that can withstand frequent use. A well-built record player will not only provide better sound quality but also last longer, making it a worthwhile investment. 



### Connectivity Options

Consider the connectivity options available with your record player with horns. Many modern models come equipped with Bluetooth, USB inputs, and even streaming capabilities, allowing you to play your favorite music from various sources. If you plan on using your record player with horns primarily for vinyl playback, this may not be a major concern. However, if you want the flexibility to play digital music files as well, look for a model with the appropriate connectivity options. 

Record players with horns offer an unparalleled listening experience for music lovers. By considering factors such as bass horn quality, driver design and placement, power requirements, durable construction, and connectivity options, you can make the best choice for your needs and preferences. With the right record player with horns, you can enjoy your favorite records with crisp, detailed sound that truly brings the music to life.
