<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/marantz-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=marantz-record-players&amp;utm_term=u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-turntable-blue-acrylic-platter-with-precision-tonearm"><img alt="u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-turntable-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-turntable-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the U-Turn Audio Orbit Plus Turntable for quite some time now, and it's become a staple for me. The acrylic platter truly enhances the sound and provides a detailed playback that I wouldn't expect from such a small and affordable turntable. The Ortofon OM5E cartridge with its elliptical diamond stylus catches every nuance in the music, while the precision OA2 gimbal tonearm ensures accurate tracking and minimal distortion. Although there's a manual belt-switching system for changing speeds, with a bit of practice, it becomes a breeze. 

One thing that stood out negatively to me was the lack of a built-in preamp. It would have been convenient to have one, but I managed to get it working with my receiver and powered speakers. Additionally, I wish the cue lever was included as an option, but with its affordability and customizability, I can't complain too much. Overall, the U-Turn Audio Orbit Plus Turntable has made a significant difference in my vinyl listening experience, and I highly recommend it to others who are looking for a quality record player at an affordable price.

I recently gave the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X-GM a spin and was pleasantly surprised by its performance. As someone who enjoys the sound of vinyl, this turntable is a great addition to my collection. 

The fully automatic belt-drive operation makes it effortless to play my favorite records, and the dual magnet phono cartridge delivers rich audio quality. The anti-resonance, die-cast aluminum platter ensures a smooth and consistent playback, while the built-in switchable phono pre-amplifier allows me to switch between phono- and line-level output. 

However, I did notice that the buttons felt a bit cheap and hollow, but this is a minor drawback considering the affordable price. Overall, I highly recommend the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X-GM to anyone looking for an entry-level, yet high-quality turntable experience.

Last week, I stumbled upon the Arkrocket Cassini vinyl turntable, and I must say, it has been an absolute game-changer in my home. Its sleek brown walnut finish, paired with its vintage-modern style, adds a touch of class to any room. The Bluetooth-enabled design allows me to seamlessly connect and stream my favorite tunes from my smartphone, and the moving magnet cartridge system ensures stable, clear playback. 

There's no denying the stunning sound quality that the 2 included 40-watt bookshelf speakers bring to the table. My living room has never sounded so good, and I really appreciate the convenience of having volume control right at my fingertips. However, one improvement I'd suggest is the inclusion of a handle, which would make it easier to move around when needed. 

Overall, the Arkrocket Cassini turntable has been a delightful addition to my daily life, offering an enhanced listening experience that I didn't know I was missing.

## Buyer's Guide

Marantz record players have been a reliable choice for music enthusiasts for decades. These record players offer superior sound quality and are designed to last. If you are in the market for a new record player, consider the following aspects when choosing a Marantz model. 


### Turntable Size and Construction

The size and construction of the turntable are crucial factors in determining the sound quality.

Look for a record player with precise speed control and a wide range of speed settings. 


### Amplification and Integration with Other Audio Components

Many Marantz record players come with built-in amplifiers, which reduces the need for external amplification units.
