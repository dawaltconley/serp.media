Chaos Walking, a pulsating action-adventure fantasy released in 2021, is an exhilarating exploration of a planet where thoughts are not kept private. The storyline revolves around two unlikely adventurers, Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) and Viola Eade (Daisy Ridley), who team up to escape a world where all thoughts are audible to everyone, including their jealous villagers. The film delves into the mind-bending scenario of mind-reading and how it tests the bonds of friendship and romance against the backdrop of a wild, untamed frontier.
