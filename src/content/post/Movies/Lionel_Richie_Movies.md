<br>

Color Me Kubrick" is a hilariously true (or so it claims) story that intertwines the lives of a man posing as legendary director Stanley Kubrick and the enigmatic production of Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999). This amateur impersonator, sporting no resemblance to the director, is ignorant about Kubrick's work but gets caught up in this farce. The entire charade is fueled by the unexpected encounters between this ordinary man and the heavy metal band involved in the film, as well as the intriguing fashion designer who crosses paths with them.
